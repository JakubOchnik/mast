# Maximum agreement subtree problem solver
A C program which loads n rooted trees and then for each pair it calculates a minimum amount of leaves which removal would make both trees isomorphic.
## Synopsis
One of the projects I made for Algorithms and Data Structures classes. A graph theory problem, known as maximum agreement subtree problem (in short, MAST).
## How does it work?
At first, a user has to enter n trees written in a [Newick notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format).
